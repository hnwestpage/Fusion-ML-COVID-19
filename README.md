# Fusion-ML-COVID-19
This repository contains the code written for "Evaluating biomedical feature fusion on machine learningâ€™s predictability and interpretability of COVID-19 severity types."

All code utilizing the methods and producing the results of our paper are copied in the file "FeatFusionStudy.ipnyb." This file is exported from Google Colaboratory, and contains the results reported in our paper. 

All data used for training and testing is available in this repository. For each variant (original and Omicron), de-identified indivisual patient level data are available as biochemical modality only, clinical(symptom) modality only, and the fusion of these two together. Data is in it's raw form.

Some sections of code are block commented out, as they were deemed useful at one time or was anticipated being useful, but were not necessary for our paper. These sections remain block commented instead of outright deleted to allow for the potential of future work with this project.
