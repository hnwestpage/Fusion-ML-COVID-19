# Fusion-ML-COVID-19
This repository contains the code written for "Evaluating biomedical feature fusion on machine learningâ€™s predictability and interpretability of COVID-19 severity types."

All code utilizing the methods and producing the results of our paper are copied in the file "FeatFusionStudy.ipnyb." This file is exported from Google Colaboratory, and contains the results reported in our paper. 

Some sections of code are block commented out, as they were deemed useful at one time or was anticipated being useful, but were not necessary for our paper. These sections remain block commented instead of outright deleted to allow for the potential of future work with this project.
